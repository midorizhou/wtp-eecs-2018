# cardcountvalue.py

# Name:
# Collaborators:

# This program takes user input of a card value and prints
# the card counting number for that card.

# MIT card counting values:
#
#    2 - 6 should add one to the count, so their value is 1
#    7 - 9 have no effect on the count, so their value is 0
#    A, 10, J, Q, and K should subtract one from the count,
# so their value is -1



# this is a list containing all of the valid values for a card
cards = ['A','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','J','Q','K']

# Write some code that takes a card as input (remember to 
# check it for validity) and outputs the MIT card counting 
# value of that card. Use multiple if/else statements
# to determine the card counting value of the user's input.


# (hint: reuse some of your code from cardlist.py)
