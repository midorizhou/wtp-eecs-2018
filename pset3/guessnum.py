# This program implements the Guess My Number! game

# Have your program generate a random number for the user
# to guess. Write a function that asks the user for a guess and 
# prints out whether it was too high, too low, or correct.
# Give the user five guesses. If the user hasn't guessed by
# then, print out the correct number.
