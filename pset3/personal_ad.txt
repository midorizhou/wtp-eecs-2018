I enjoy long, ADJECTIVE walks on the beach, getting VERB ENDING IN "ED" in the rain and serendipitous encounters with NOUN (PLURAL). I really like pi√±a coladas mixed with LIQUID, and romantic, candle-lit NOUN (PLURAL). I am looking for NOUN and beauty in the form of a NATIONALITY god. He should have the physique of MALE CELEBRITY.
